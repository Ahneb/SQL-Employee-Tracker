## Description
This is a CLI application that can be used to manage a database of employees using SQL. Using inquirer, you are prompted through questions that allow you to view `departments`, `roles`, and `employees'. There is also the ability to add additional departments, roles and employees. Additional functionality includes the ability to update an employee's role, and manager. This makes use of a series of nested prompts. The prompts also go through a few checks to ensure that an answer is being given as well as the option to leave the application at anytime by typing `esc`.
